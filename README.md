This is an audio plugin in C++ using [JUCE](https://juce.com/) that plays MIDI notes by morphing hand-drawn waveforms.

This project and the accompanying [series of articles](https://medium.com/@akaztp/journey-into-audio-programming-1-getting-involved-c71f026a63b1) document my journey into the audio programming world where I ended up with a fully functional audio plugin that plays MIDI notes by morphing waveforms.
